# README: Relevant Data Points for ML Model from Kepler, K2, and TESS Exoplanet Archives

This document summarizes the key data columns from NASA Exoplanet Archive catalogs for **Kepler**, **K2**, and **TESS (TOI)** missions, which should be consolidated and used as inputs/features for the Machine Learning (ML) model aimed at exoplanet detection and characterization.

## Notes and Consolidation Guidelines

- Column names might differ slightly across catalogs:  
  - Kepler uses `kepid`; TESS uses `tid`; K2 uses `epic_hostname`. These should be harmonized as a general `"id"` or `"name"` column.  
  - Transit mid-time may be `pl_tranmid` or similarly named.  
- Not all catalogs provide all parameters; use available columns and handle missing values cautiously.  
- Common columns around orbital and transit parameters, stellar properties, and disposition are most crucial for your ML model.  
- Use these stellar and planetary parameters as **metadata features** to augment the time series input from light curves.

## Using Lightkurve-derived Light Curve Data

- For ML input time series, use **PDC (Pre-search Data Conditioning) light curves**, which are cleaned flux time series optimal for transit detection.  
- Phase fold light curves using `pl_orbper` and `pl_tranmid` to align transit events.  
- Use the `pdcsap_flux` field in Lightkurve objects for flux time series input.

## Summary of Final Input Features for ML Model

- **Time Series Input:** Phase folded, normalized PDC light curve flux vs time segments around transits.  
- **Tabular Features:**
  - Orbital period (`pl_orbper`)  
  - Transit mid-time (`pl_tranmid`)  
  - Transit duration (`pl_trandurh`)  
  - Transit depth (`pl_trandep`)  
  - Planet radius (`pl_rade`)  
  - Stellar effective temperature (`st_teff`)  
  - Stellar radius (`st_rad`)  
  - Stellar surface gravity (`st_logg`)  
  - Stellar distance (`st_dist`)  
  - Planet disposition/class label (`disposition`)
